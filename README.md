Image scraping using Python &amp; Flask

In this Project, I have done Image scraping in python (using flask).

Image scraping is a subset of the web scraping technology. While web scraping deals with all forms of web data extraction, image scraping only focuses on the media side â€“ images, videos, audio, and so on.

All the installing that are required is given in the requirements.txt file.

This is just a simple version. You can play around with the code for executing other things.

PS: Give your own password & username for creating a MongoDB database.
